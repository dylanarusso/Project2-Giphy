Project 2 - Giphy "What Do You GIF?"

Dylan A. Russo
Cohort 12-B


Description of Project
In this project I am creating a website that will allow you to search a massive amount of GIFs. This website will be connected to the GIPHY search engine so you can search through their library of GIFs. 

Details on how to use
On the main page, there will be a search bar that will give you the choice of searching for a certain GIF that you are looking for. When you type in what you are looking for then you will click on the search button that will pull the information from GIPHY and will show up on the screen so you are able to see the GIFs that you searched for.

Technologies used are HTML, CSS, README.md, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery

In the future I want to improve the website in many different ways
    1. Be able to have users download the GIFs they are searching for
    2. Expand the website to have more pages with more information
    3. Make website for interactive with different options to search 

User Stories
1. As a website user, I want to be able to access the website and navigate it with ease so I can get what I was coming for
2. As a website user, I want to go onto the website and see an entertaining page so I have the thrive to revist the page
3. As a website user, I want to make sure that when I visit the website I can know what the website is used for
